# Introduction

As an aspiring Data Storyteller, I believe in Aristotle's idea of "we learn by doing" - which inspired this project as a hands-on practice with SQL and Python skills to analyze current job skill demands and compensation patterns in the field I aspire to enter.

This project will analyze the data job market as of June 2025 examing salary information, skill requirements, and remote work opportunities.

# Background

Driven by a quest to understand the current job market more effectively, this project was created to identify top-paid and in-demand skills, helping streamline the job search process for aspiring data professionals, such as myself.

The data derives from [Luke Barousse's SQL Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). Luke's guidance, lessons, and data inspired me to build a project that not only develops SQL skills, but applies these skills to answer real-world questions for aspiring data professionals like myself.

### The following questions were answered through my SQL Queries:

1. What are the top paying data jobs (data analyst, data scientist, business analyst, and data engineer)?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying data roles?
3. What skills are most in demand for these data positions?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries in the data field?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for aspiring data professionals?

# Tools I Used

For my analysis, I used several powerful tools:

- **SQL**: The foundation of my analysis, allowing me to query the database for critical insights
- **PostgreSQL**: The database management system that was chosen for this project to handle the job posting data
- **Python**: The programming language used for data visualization, utilizing libraries such as pandas and matplotlib
- **Visual Studio Code**: The code editor used to execute the queries and build the visuals
- **Git and GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my project for collaboration and project tracking
